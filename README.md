Final project for Causal Inference at NYU Steinhardt, Fall 2020. Analysis of impact of the DREAM-SHSI program, which funds a free Saturday and summer academic program to prepare 7th graders in NYC public schools to take the Specialized High School Admissions Test in the 8th grade. An instrumental variable model was used to find that compliance average causal effect of the program on students attending the program was that they would score higher than their peers who did not. A propensity score matching method determined that this causal effect was more effective for Black and Hispanic students than it was for White and Asian students, who had higher baseline test scores.

Data generation process created to mimic real student-level data provided by the Research Alliance for NYC Schools.
